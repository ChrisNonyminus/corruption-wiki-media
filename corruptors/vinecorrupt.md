VineCorrupt is a multi-system corrupter designed to work with game systems ranging from NES to Wii with further inclusive development for other systems.  VineCorrupt features opcode and file protection for its supported systems to minimize crashes.  Each system has a different protection protocol according to their instruction set or file type to prevent crash inducing modifications.  VinecCorrupt also features the ability to corrupt specific files within a disc through a directory structure.

### Functions

![](/assets/vinecorrupt/VineCorruptFunctions.png)

This section goes over the functions of VineCorrupt.

##### ROM File

Choose a ROM file by selecting "Browse."  The ROM's directory path will be displayed once the ROM has been selected.

##### Extract To

Choose a directory by selecting "Browse," to extract the contents of the selected ROM.  This directory's files will be the target for corruption.

##### Emulator

Choose an emulator by selecting "Browse," to point to the emulator that runs the ROM files from the current tab.  The selected emulator will remain selected for the specified system until the user chooses another one or VineCorrupt is updated.

##### Save

Shows a display box with a code that can be loaded to restore the current settings.  These values correspond to the current corruption options.

##### Save Last

Once a ROM is corrupted, you can save it to a custom directory with this option.  It will be deleted from the corrupter directory afterwards.

##### Load

Shows a display box that allows the user to enter a code generated by a "save" operation.  Submitting a code will restore previous corruption settings.  This code corresponds to the current corruption options.

##### Corrupt 

Starts the corruption process with the current settings.  If an "Extract To" directory is listed, the files within this directory will be corrupted.

##### Run Emulator

If an emulator is selected, it will attempt t o run the emulator with the given ROM as an argument.  If an emulator has already been run this way, it will be closed.  The option does not work with all emulators and the run/auto-close feature may not operate properly.

##### Miscellaneous Files

![](/assets/vinecorrupt/VineCorruptMisc.png)

VineCorrupt supports non-specific file corruption for unsupported systems.  It is not recommended to use this function if the supplied file is already supported by a VineCorrupt system due to the built-in file protection.  Miscellaneous file corruption is performed in the same manner as supported system file corruption.

### Byte Corruption

![](/assets/vinecorrupt/VineCorruptOptions.png)

This section goes over the "Corruption Options" section of VineCorrupt.

##### Step Size

The amount of space to skip between each corruption.

##### Start Byte

The offset into the ROM where the program will start corruption.

##### End Byte

The offset into the ROM where the program will stop corruption.  Setting this value to 0 will corrupt from the Start Byte to the end of the file (similar to "Auto-end").

##### Total Bytes

This displays the total bytes of the ROM in hexadecimal once the file has been selected.

##### Bytes Corrupted

This displays the total bytes corrupted with the current settings after the ROM has been corrupted.

##### Corruption Selection

The drop down box lists all the current corruption types.  The currently selected one will be applied after hitting Corrupt.
