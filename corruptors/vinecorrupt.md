> ### While you can still use this corruptor, we suggest using the [Real Time Corruptor](http://redscientist.com/#/rtc "Real Time Corruptor RTC") whenever you can. The RTC is under active development and has far more features than other corruptors.

VineCorrupt is a multi-system corrupter designed to work with game systems ranging from NES to Wii with further inclusive development for other systems.  VineCorrupt features opcode and file protection for its supported systems to minimize crashes.  Each system has a different protection protocol according to their instruction set or file type to prevent crash inducing modifications.  VinecCorrupt also features the ability to corrupt specific files within a disc through a directory structure.

### Functions

![](/assets/vinecorrupt/VineCorruptFunctions.png)

###### File Selection - ROM File

Choose a ROM file by selecting "Browse."  The ROM's directory path will be displayed once the ROM has been selected.

##### File Selection - Extract To

Choose a directory by selecting "Browse," to extract the contents of the selected ROM.  This directory's files will be the target for corruption.

##### File Selection - Emulator

Choose an emulator by selecting "Browse," to point to the emulator that runs the ROM files from the current tab.  The selected emulator will remain selected for the specified system until the user chooses another one or VineCorrupt is updated.

##### Save

Shows a display box with a code that can be loaded to restore the current settings.  These values correspond to the current corruption options.

##### Save Last

Once a ROM is corrupted, you can save it to a custom directory with this option.  It will be deleted from the corrupter directory afterwards.

##### Load

Shows a display box that allows the user to enter a code generated by a "save" operation.  Submitting a code will restore previous corruption settings.  This code corresponds to the current corruption options.

##### Corrupt 

Starts the corruption process with the current settings.  If an "Extract To" directory is listed, the files within this directory will be corrupted.
