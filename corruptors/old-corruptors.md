## Old Corruptors

Some of the oldest ROM corruption software date back to the year 2000, before the creation and the popularization of the Vinesauce ROM Corruptor. Some of these are meant mostly for editing NES ROMs without the use of a full Hex editor, the ability to break games being a secondary use.

Originally made to hack NES ROMs by modifying individual bytes or byte ranges, it's secondary use of breaking games is a popular alternative. ROM Corruptor was [originally used by Vinesauce](https://youtu.be/b3SubgihMfE?t=6s) in their early days of streaming corruptions. The version you can download above has a fix for usage on Windows 7 and later, if you want the original file download it from [here](/assets/old-corruptors/corrupt.zip).

Corrupster was originally made as a utility for hacking Final Fantasy 1 NES Roms but is used exclusively for corrupting NES ROMs as you can't choose any files that aren't a \*.nes.

The Corruptor is based off of an unknown software called File Corrupt 4.0 according to it's [Zophar page](https://www.zophar.net/utilities/corruptutil/erosion.html). Erosion was a more advanced corruptor for it's time with features like using powers, values, random values, overwrite specific values and byte ranges among other options. It has option backup and option logging features so you can know what offsets were written and what value was placed within. The source code is included with the first version.

NoChaos is more of a recursive Hex editor than it is meant to be a corruptor. However it's description on his website states that it is used for "Controlled corruption".

### Sapros

Sapros is a simple NES ROM corruptor that utilises the CDL files produced by FCEUXD, a NES debugger,  to provide added precision to the corruption process.

## Permanent Game Genie

###### Author: [Robert A. Durbin](http://www.romhacking.net/community/1434/)

###### Release date: March 2, 2002

###### [Download](https://web.archive.org/web/20140328195900/http://www.zophar.net/fileuploads/1/3090cknyl/gamegenie.zip)

###### ![](/assets/old-corruptors/img/PermaGenie.jpg)

Not a corruptor in the traditional sense but this program takes Game Genie code and permanently inserts them into NES ROMs, normally with Game Genie codes they are executed within an emulator instead of being written directly to the ROM. Using this tool you can overlap some interesting codes and create unique corruptions.
