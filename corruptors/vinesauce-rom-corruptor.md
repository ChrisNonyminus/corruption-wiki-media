The Vinesauce ROM Corruptor is a corruptor that allows you to change the bytes of any file by tweaking some simple settings. Itâ€™s development thus far has been biased toward corrupting NES ROM files for the best corruption effects, but since it works on any file it can be used to corrupt any kind of ROM or game data file.
