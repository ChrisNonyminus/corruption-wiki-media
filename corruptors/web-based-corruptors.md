In Japan, corruptions are called チートバグ (cheatbug). There is a community of people who do cheatbugs.
There is a tool called Urajijo, which is an html with various "generation centers" where you can randomly generate cheatcodes for particular systems.
The tool is not in English but it is easy to use if you use a translator.
