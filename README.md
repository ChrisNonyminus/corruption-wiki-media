# The Corruptions Wiki.

![](/assets/corruption-definition.png)

Corruptions or the act of corrupting is taking a video game and breaking it using whatever means necessary, usually with a program called a corruptor. This software can either modify the bytes in a ROM or a game's files to produce unexpected or unusual graphics, gameplay or audio, often resulting in hilarity and or invoking Satan.

### Types of corruption

##### Visual

2D and 3D visuals can be effected by corrupting a game. For example, if you were to corrupt a sprite on the SNES it would result in different colors, offset pixels, flipped textures, or a change in hue. If you were to corrupt a model in a 3D game it would result in stretched, distorted, flat or just plain broken polygons and mesh.

##### Audio

Corrupting a game can modify it's audio and music, depending on how you corrupted the game. For example, if you corrupted a SNES ROM and modified music data it can crackle, scramble, pitch up or down, slow down, speed up, change the track entirely or all at the same time.
