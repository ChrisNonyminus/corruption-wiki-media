# The Corruptions Wiki.

Corruptions or the act of corrupting is taking a video game and breaking it using whatever means necessary, usually with a program called a corruptor. This software can either modify the bytes in a ROM or a game's files to produce unexpected or unusual graphics, gameplay or audio, often resulting in hilarity and or invoking Satan.

### Types of corruption

#### Visual

2D and 3D visuals can be effected by corrupting a game. For example, if you were to corrupt a sprite on the SNES it would result in different colors, offset pixels, flipped textures, or a change in hue. If you were to corrupt a model in a 3D game it would result in stretched, distorted, flat or just plain broken polygons and mesh.

#### Audio

Corrupting a game can modify it's audio and music, depending on how you corrupted the game. For example, if you corrupted a SNES ROM and modified music data it can crackle, scramble, pitch up or down, slow down, speed up, change the track entirely or all at the same time.

 Gameplay

Gameplay corruptions happen when a gameplay mechanic is altered by a corruption which can result in anything from misplaced characters to the player being able to jump 10 times higher than usual. Gameplay corruptions are not as common as audio and video corruptions because it requires game code to be altered but still run correctly.
